# ChatMate

ChatMate is a local network-based chat application where users can create and join chat groups with a passkey. The program allows multiple users to connect within the same local network, chat in real-time, and assigns each user a unique color for their messages.

## Features

- **Group Creation**: Create a chat group with a name and passkey.
- **Join Group**: Join an existing group using the group name and passkey.
- **User Identification**: Each user enters a username when joining, which is displayed with their messages.
- **Colored Messages**: Each user gets a unique color in the chat for easy identification.
- **Local Network Chat**: Communicate with users on the same local network.

## How It Works

- **Server Mode**: The user who creates the group acts as the server, and others connect to them.
- **Client Mode**: Other users on the network join the chat by providing the group name, passkey, and server IP.

## Installation

  - `termcolor`
